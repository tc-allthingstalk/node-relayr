# node-relayr

Relayr sensor SDK for node.

Works by connecting to the MQTT channel associated with your Relayr connected
device.

## Status
This is still not much more thatn a utiity script, but will grow to expose a
lot more useful functionality.

## installation

npm install relayr
```

## connecting

var Relayr = require('relayr');
```

```js
var app_id = "YOURAPPID";
var dev_id = "YOURDEVICEID";
var token  = "YOURSENSORTOKEN";
```
Initialise the libary

```js
var relayr = new Relayr(app_id);
```

Connect using the keys:
```js
relayr.connect(token, dev_id);
```

Listen and do stuff
```js
relayr.on('data', function (topic, msg) {
        console.log(topic + ":" + msg);
}
```

Send a Command
